  				<p>Find userful aliases from others just like you. Might find something to help your workflow.</p>
          <p>I had found a similar site back in the day and have recently gotten more accostomed to the Terminal and more involved programming.</p>
          <p>From then on I have revisted aliases to help make long commands shorter and I am a little lazy to not memorize all of them correctly</p>
          <p>Aliases are shorthand methods to perform complicated tasks or to speed up the process.<p>
