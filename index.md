title: "Alias Commands"
excerpt: "A way for you to share your and learn programming aliases"

# Website is coming soon
I remember getting into scripting on many different platforms and always having to remember really long commands to do simple things. I looked into it and there is a thing called ```Alias```. This allows you to create a user command for a set of commands.


While searching the InterWebs, I came across a popular  site, alias.sh. This website was dedicated to sharing other programmers aliases to help with productivity and creativity.


I hope with this project we can bring this concept back to life.
